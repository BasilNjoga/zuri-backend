# zuri-backend
This is a repository for the backend projects i've been working on during an online internship at Zuri's HNGX. All projects have their own README.md and a DOCUMENTATION.md whenever necessary

It consists of a series of fundamental backend tasks and technologies including
- making API's and API endpoints
- CRUD operations using API

The projects include

- [Creating and Hosting API Endpoints](https://github.com/BasilNjoga/zuri-backend/tree/main/create-and-host-endpoint) 
 This is an API endpoint built with python and fastapi it allows you to perfom get and post request and it is hosted on render

- [Django Rest API CRUD functionality](https://github.com/BasilNjoga/zuri-backend/tree/main/restapi-crud-operations)
This is a restful API built with Django and Django rest Framework, it allows you to perfom common CRUD opeations such GET, POST, PUT, PATCH , DELETE. 
 I have provided thorough documentation on how to set up the project or use it via the internet and the endpoints for each operation
